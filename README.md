### pentumbra.space scripts
the scripts for my old website, pentumbra.space. i dont have a lot of these commented nor do i use print statements to debug, so i recommend that you are intermediate in javascript, or are at least somewhat competent in programming languages in general. ★
> some of these scripts havent been edited for months. sometimes they're unoptomized and inefficient, which makes it difficult to edit (for beginners). just a heads up lol
___ 
feel free to use these without credit i dont care lmaooo
